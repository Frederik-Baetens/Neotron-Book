# RS-232

A four-wire (`TX`, `RX`, `RTS`, `CTS`) RS-232 interface is provided via a 10-pin 0.1" boxed header. These headers are used on old ISA Serial Port expansion cards for when the 9-pin D-Sub (*DE9*, not *DB9*) receptacle didn't fit on the edge of the card and had to be moved to a second bracket, one slot over.

The `DTR`, `DSR`, `DCD` and `RI` pins are not connected.
