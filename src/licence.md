# Licence

Neotron is designed to be open - the user must have free rein to inspect the source code and the schematics, and change them to suit their needs. To this end, the main BIOS and OS implementations are licensed under the [GNU Public Licence v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or any later version. To encourage the adoption of Rust for embedded development, most of the library crates developed for this project are licensed under both the [MIT] and [Apache 2.0] licences, just like the Rust compiler itself. We do intend to sell a range of kits and pre-built PCBs, but you can (and should!) take our designs as inspiration and put your own spin on them.
